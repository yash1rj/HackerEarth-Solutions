Jadoo's best friend is in trouble. 
In order to save him, he has been given a task. The task is : Print the reverse of a given String Input. 
But, as you know that Jadoo is too lazy, he decides to do this using shortest code possible. Please help him, will you?

INPUT

A given String S of length N [1<=N<=1000]

OUTPUT

The reverse of that whole string

SCORING

This is a codegolf problem. Score = maxScore* (100 - S)/100

S = Number of characters in source code.

If S > 100, then score = 0.

Symbols with ASCII Code <=32 doesn't count as a character for the checker code. 

Note: Your Code should contain characters < 100

Note: We encourage you not to use comments in your code for this type of problem

SAMPLE INPUT 
Jadoo
SAMPLE OUTPUT 
oodaJ
'''

print(input()[::-1])
